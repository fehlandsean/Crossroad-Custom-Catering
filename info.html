  <center><p class="round2">I chose Crossroads for my wedding, and am so glad I did. All of my guests raved about how wonderful the food was. My husband and I can't stop talking about it either. The staff was so wonderful to everyone. They even packed up the leftovers for us which was a godsend because we barely had time to eat during the reception. They were always kind and responsive during the planning process as well. I am beyond thankful for them! We had Chicken Mahogany or Hickory Smoked Tenderloin, whipped mashed potato bar, green beans, rolls, and sweet tea. We were hesitant about the tenderloin at first, just because sometimes pork can get overcooked rather quickly. These guys nailed it! Our tenderloin was cooked PERFECTLY! The chicken was also very good, but we are a pork family (my husband works for Tosh Farms). If you're feeding any amount of people, these folks should definitely be your caterers. I cannot say enough wonderful things about them. They made my wedding wonderful!  -B.B.</p></center>
